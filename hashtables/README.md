# Hash Tables Sprint Challenge

For the hash tables portion of the sprint challenge, you'll be working through some algorithm problems that are amenable to being solved efficiently using a hash table. You know the drill at this point. Navigate into each exercise's directory, read the instructions for the exercise laid out in the README, implement your solution in the `.py` skeleton file, then make sure your code passes the tests by running the test script with `-v`.

A hash table implementation has been included for you already. Your task is to get the tests passing by using hash table. You can remind yourself of what hash table functions are available by looking at the `hashtable.py` file that is included in each exercise directory (note that the hash table implementations for both exercises differ slightly).
